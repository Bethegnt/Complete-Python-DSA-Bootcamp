    "### **Types of Number System**\n",
    "There are `four common types` of number systems based on the radix or base of the number :\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `Decimal Number System`\n",
    "- The Decimal system is a `base-10` number system.\n",
    "- It uses ten digits: `0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9.`\n",
    "- Each digit’s place value is a` power of 10` (e.g., 10^0, 10^1, 10^2).\n",
    "- It is the `standard system` for everyday counting and calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `Binary Number System`\n",
    "- The Binary system is a `base-2` number system.\n",
    "- It uses two digits:` 0 and 1.`\n",
    "- Each digit’s place value is a `power of 2` (e.g., 2^0, 2^1, 2^2).\n",
    "- The Binary system is the foundation for `data representation in computers and digital electronics.`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `Octal Number System`\n",
    "- The Octal system is a `base-8` number system.\n",
    "- It uses eight digits: `0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7.`\n",
    "- Each digit’s place value is a `power of 8` (e.g., 8^0, 8^1, 8^2).\n",
    "- It is often used to `simplify the representation of binary numbers` by `grouping them into sets of three bits.`\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `Hexadecimal Number System`\n",
    "- The Hexadecimal system is a `base-16` number system.\n",
    "- It uses sixteen digits: `0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E and F` (where A = 10, B = 11, etc.).\n",
    "- Each digit’s place value is a `power of 16` (e.g., 16^0, 16^1, 16^2).\n",
    "- Hexadecimal simplifies `binary by representing every 4 bits` as one digit (0-F)."
